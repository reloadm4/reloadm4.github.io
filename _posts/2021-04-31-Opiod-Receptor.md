Opiod receptors are situated in the brain or say The Central Nervouus System. There are few categories of these receptors. When the opiod reaches the brain, these receptors are ready to absorb them and create the "feel good" experience . Thia topic is forther explained below.

<H2>Categories</H2>
There are three important classes of opioid receptors and these are:

<ul><li>μ receptor or Mu receptors - There are three subtypes of this receptor, the μ1, μ2 and μ3 receptors. Present in the brainstem and the thalamus, activation of these receptors can result in pain relief, sedation and euphoria as well as respiratory depression, constipation and physical dependence.</li>
<li>κ receptor or kappa receptor - This receptor is present in the limbic system, part of the forebrain called the diencephalon, the brain stem and spinal cord. Activation of this receptor causes pain relief, sedation, loss of breath and dependence.</li>
<li>δ receptor or delta - This receptor is widely distributed in the brain and also present in the spinal cord and digestive tract. Stimulation of this receptor leads to analgesic as well as antidepressant effects but may also cause respiratory depression.</li></ul>

<H2>Digging Deeper</H2>
The opioid system controls pain, reward and addictive behaviors. Opioids exert their pharmacological actions through three opioid receptors, mu, delta and kappa whose genes have been cloned (Oprm, Oprd1 and Oprk1, respectively). Opioid receptors in the brain are activated by a family of endogenous peptides like enkephalins, dynorphins and endorphin, which are released by neurons. Opioid receptors can also be activated exogenously by alkaloid opiates, the prototype of which is morphine, which remains the most valuable painkiller in contemporary medicine.

<H3>mu-Opioid-Receptor</H3>
The finding that morphine's analgesic and addictive properties are abolished in mice lacking the mu-opioid receptor has unambiguously demonstrated that mu-receptors mediate both the therapeutic and the adverse activities of this compound
Mice lacking the mu-receptor gene show:
<ul>
<li>a loss of morphine-induced analgesia, reward, and dependence</li>
<li>increased sensitivity to painful stimuli</li>
<li>reduced reward to non-opioid drugs of abuse</li>
<li>altered emotional responses</li> </ul>

<H3>Delta-Opioid-Receptor</H3>
Delta-receptors regulate emotional responses and for the first time a genetic manipulation was pioneered to achieve functional imaging of opioid receptors in vivo.

<H2>CONCLUSION</H2>
Opiate addicts, who mainly abuse the mu-opioid agonist heroin, present a high incidence of depressive disorders that seem to contribute to the maintenance of the addictive state. Also, the treatment of chronic pain states frequently includes antidepressant therapy. Therefore, in addition to their potential analgesic activity, delta-agonists may be useful in improving emotional states and, more generally, may be considered in the future as an alternative therapy to alleviate affective disorders.
