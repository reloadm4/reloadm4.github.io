The opium poppy is a plant whose sap is used to make top level drugs.
Though the word drug meaning both the sides.

This is true that the opium poppy has been a gift for the people suffering through severe pain. How?
Basically the opium plantation is very controlled in the developed as well as in some developing countries. The opium poppy plant (sap) contains Heroin, Codeine, Morphine, Thebaine ..

Opium is a substance extracted from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.). Its consumption and medicinal application date back to antiquity.

Therefore the poppy sap if intended could be used to make some hardcore drugs.
On the other hand, the sap is also used in Pharmaceuticals Industry. Here comes the painkillers which we were talking about. These painkillers using the opoid receptors in brain produces a numbing effect at a very deep level.
So, this nature of opium poppy is used in making all sorts of painkillers effects ranging from  mild (moderate) to very high as required.


<H2>Opium in Medical Industry</H2>

Throughout history, opium has been used as a base for the opioid class of drugs used to suppress the central nervous system. 
Opium was for many centuries the principal painkiller known to medicine and was used in various forms and under various names. Laudanum, for example, was an alcoholic tincture (dilute solution) of opium that was used in European medical practice as an analgesic and sedative.
The opioids are a large class of medications related in structure to the natural plant alkaloids found in opium that are derived from the resin of the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum. The natural alkaloids are also referred to as opiates and include morphine and codeine. Synthetic derivatives include heroin, fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, buprenorphine and others. The opioids are highly potent and effective analgesics, but most have a high potential for dependency and abuse.
We will talk about each of them in subsequent posts.

However, there are several drugs produced with the opium poppy plant. And they are being used to make such substances/drugs from centuries. I will explain the process in brief:
First of all the sap from the poppy is taken in raw form.
After some steps of processing we get a tar like substance which is called
afeem or Opium. This is a very raw form of tthe drug. Though this is a very basic form of opium, people use this bay mixing in their smoke or with tea.
Now, in the further approach this tar substance is further processed with "acetic anhydride" to get the form of Heroin. Its street names include: H, Horse, Brown, Skank etc..
The byproduct of the above mentioned process is what we call "brown sugar" which is also abused by many.
Heroin is considered the highest form of opium. But not for long. Substances with more potential and power were developed by doing further research on this product. Today we have substances like Fentanyl, Carfentanil ...
These substances are very lethal if taken even in slightly more quantity.
(Carfentanil is not for human use. As far it is used to sedate animals like elephant)
