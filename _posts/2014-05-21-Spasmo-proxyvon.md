<H1><b>Introduction</b></H1>

Spasmo-Proxyvon Plus Capsule is a combination medicine used in the treatment of acute pain. It works effectively to reduce pain and cramps by relaxing the muscles of the stomach and gut. It also blocks certain chemical messengers that cause pain.

Spasmo-Proxyvon Plus Capsule is taken with or without food in a dose and duration as advised by the doctor. The dose you are given will depend on your condition and how you respond to the medicine. You should keep taking this medicine for as long as your doctor recommends. If you stop treatment too early your symptoms may come back and your condition may worsen. Let your healthcare team know about all other medications you are taking as some may affect, or be affected by this medicine.

The most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, constipation, dryness in mouth, weakness, nervousness, and blurred vision. Most of these are temporary and usually resolve with time. Contact your doctor straight away if you are at all concerned about any of these side effects. It may also cause sleepiness, so do not drive or do anything that requires mental focus until you know how this medicine affects you. Avoid drinking alcohol while taking this medicine as it can worsen your sleepiness.

Before taking this medicine, you should tell your doctor if you are pregnant, planning pregnancy or breastfeeding. You should also tell your doctor if you have any kidney or liver diseases so that your doctor can prescribe a suitable dose for you.
