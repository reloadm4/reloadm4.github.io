<H2>Introduction</H2>
Morphine is a pain medication of the opiate family that is found naturally in a dark brown, resinous form, from the poppy plant (Papaver somniferum). It can be taken orally or injected; it is also often smoked.[7][9] It acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to increase feelings of pleasure and warm relaxation and reduce pain, and is often abused for this purpose.

<H2>History</H2>

Morphine was isolated from opium by the German chemist F.W.A. Sertürner in about 1804. In its power to reduce the level of physical distress, morphine is among the most important naturally occurring compounds, being of use in the treatment of pain caused by cancer and in cases where other analgesics have failed.
Morphine was the first actual medicine to be extracted and fomulated from opium poppy. This comes in form of tablets ( 10mg 30mg 60mg..) and injection veils.
In case of a Heart Attack  the patient is injected with morphine as an SOS.

<H2>Pharmacokinetics</H2>

<br>Morphine can be administered orally, intravenously, rectally, subcutaneously, through spinal injection (e.g. epidural) as well as through inhalation or snorting. The drug has a significant amount of first-pass metabolism in the liver with only around 40 to 50% of the amount absorbed actually reaching the nervous system. Most of the morphine is processed in the kidneys and eliminated from the body in urine.

<H2>Opiod Receptors</H2>

In order to understand how these drugs/medicines work on our Central Nervous System, first we will know about the receptors in our brain.
There are three important classes of opioid receptors and these are:

<ul><li>μ receptor or Mu receptors - There are three subtypes of this receptor, the μ1, μ2 and μ3 receptors. Present in the brainstem and the thalamus, activation of these receptors can result in pain relief, sedation and euphoria as well as respiratory depression, constipation and physical dependence.</li>
<li>κ receptor or kappa receptor - This receptor is present in the limbic system, part of the forebrain called the diencephalon, the brain stem and spinal cord. Activation of this receptor causes pain relief, sedation, loss of breath and dependence.</li>
<li>δ receptor or delta - This receptor is widely distributed in the brain and also present in the spinal cord and digestive tract. Stimulation of this receptor leads to analgesic as well as antidepressant effects but may also cause respiratory depression.</li></ul>

<br>This concept is very important for discussing the other opiate/opiods on the list.


<H2>Morphine Addiction</H2>
Like many prescription drugs, addiction to Morphine most often grows out of a need for the pain reliever. Typically, someone starts Morphine as a prescription. Overtime, that person will soon find that it doesn’t provide as much relief over time. This means that their body is building a tolerance to the Opioid and could lead to them upping their dose. Without a doctor’s supervision tapering off the medication, the person can potentially go off cold turkey and go into withdrawal.

A person who was prescribed Morphine may not realize that they’ve developed a dependency until their prescription runs out. By that time, it’s too late for them to go back to a doctor. Craving the drug, many go to the street to procure it illicitly. Individuals looking to abuse or sell Morphine will often go “doctor shopping” (going to multiple physicians to keep getting prescriptions), or they’ll turn to a different drug they can get cheaper. Buying Morphine on the street is expensive, usually due to the high cost and difficulty of procuring Morphine. That is why many will turn to Heroin. Most people addicted to Heroin got there from another Opioid addiction. Whether they were unable to procure it, or couldn’t afford it anymore, at some point the majority of them can no longer get access to Morphine. That is where Heroin, the stronger, cheaper alternative, comes into play.

<H2>How to quit Morphine addiction? </H2>
<br>Let's say I have started writing this blog with thw ultimatum to cover this topic.
I will provide with the best ways to wean off these drugs rather than suffering with cold turkey.
Please follow my subsequent posts for this topic as it will be covered at last so that I have minimal audience whom I can help with my experience.
